- rake task cleanup on doc to use YARD instead of rdoc
- rake task cleanup, move some of the maintainer stuff to a maintainer namespace and separate rake file.
- <del>rake task that pulls down relevant resources more easily from code.angular.js</del>
- sample more from https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails to get this thing properly bootstrapped.
- <del>update gemspec summary</del>
- improve generator to help with stable and unstable assets generation.
